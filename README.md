# Mouse Glow Halo effect

> This is a very simple pure javascript plugin which enbles a halo effect round your mouse for the selected container.

To get up and running, all you have to do is the good old `npm i` or just `yarn` it
In your project you then need to import `mouseGlow` using the following method:
`import mouseGlow from 'mouse_glow'`

Usage
```
import mouseGlow from 'mouse_glow'
mouse_glow(element,color)
```

mouse_glow accepts two parameters, both of type `string` where the first is your selector (pass selector css style `.class or #id`)
The second parameter is the original background color of the container where you want to apply the effect.

Enjoy and star if you like.
